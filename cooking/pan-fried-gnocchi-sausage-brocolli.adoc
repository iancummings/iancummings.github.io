Serves 4

== Ingredients
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 500g/1lb 2oz fresh gnocchi
* 6 sausages
* 4 garlic cloves, finely sliced
* ½ tsp fennel seeds, crushed
* 1 broccoli, stalk quartered and finely sliced, head cut into florets
* 150ml/¼ pint white wine
* 2 tbsp honey (hot honey would work well too)
* 150g/5½oz taleggio, chopped into small cubes
* sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* rocket salad, to serve

NOTE: You could use mozzarella or halloumi if you can't get hold of taleggio.


== Method
1. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large, lidded, flameproof frying pan and place on a high heat. Add the gnocchi to the pan and fry for around 2 minutes, tossing occasionally, until it becomes a little charred all over. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

1. Keep the pan off the heat and squeeze the sausage meat out of the sausage skins into the pan, roughly breaking it up as you go. Place the pan on a medium-high heat, add another tablespoon of olive oil and fry the sausage meat for around 5–8 minutes, until coloured and cooked through.

1. Add the garlic and fennel seeds to the pan, then after a minute add all of the broccoli. Fry for a further minute, then pour in the wine. Bring it to the boil, allow to boil for a minute, then cover with a lid and reduce the heat a little. Cook for around 3 minutes, or until the broccoli is just cooked. At this point preheat the grill to high.

1. When the broccoli is ready, season everything with salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle with the honey. Stir in the fried gnocchi and dot over the taleggio. Pop the pan under the grill and grill for 3–5 minutes, until the cheese is oozy and everything is slightly blistered. Serve with a rocket salad on the side.
