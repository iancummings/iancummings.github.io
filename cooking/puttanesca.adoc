* Parmigiano Reggiano to grates


=== Method

NOTE: use the Sauteuse pan

1. Chop the anchovies & olives

1. Put the kettle on for the spaghetti

1. Add the garlic and chilli, if using, and cook for a further minute.

1. Stir the tomatoes, anchovies, olives and capers into the onion, bring to a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 mins. *Season to taste.*

1. Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the spaghetti following pack instructions, then drain and toss with the sauce and basil.



*Cook’s tip*
Leftover capers? These are small pickled flower buds with a deliciously briny flavour. They’re great in buttery sauces to spoon over chicken or fish, or can be chopped and stirred through mayonnaise to spread in sandwiches.
