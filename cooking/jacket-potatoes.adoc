= Jacket Potatoes

== Jamie
(from link:https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/brilliant-baked-potato-fillings/[Jamie] - also his  link:https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/potato-skins-four-ways/[loaded skins])

Medium 100-170g

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.
1. Wash and scrub the potato and dry with a clean tea towel – dry skin will ensure it’ll be crispy once baked.
1. Rub with olive oil (oil also helps the skin go golden) and season with sea salt, then use a fork to pierce it six times, all around the potato.
1. Place on a baking tray and bake for 1 hour to 1¼ hours, until the potato is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
1. Transfer to a board and cut open straight away – if you let the potato sit after baking, the interior will steam and the potato can become soggy and heavy.

Grate up a colourful mix of red cabbage, carrot, apple, red onion and gherkins and dress with a splash of the gherkin juice, extra virgin olive oil and your choice of soft herbs, then use it to top your potato. Crumble over feta cheese and sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts for extra crunch.

=== Caramelised Red Onion & Bacon
image:bacon-potato.jpg[]

Roughly chop smoked streaky bacon (200g) and fry off with thinly sliced red onion and a handful of fresh thyme sprigs. Stir through (much more than a) handful of baby spinach leaves, then pile into your potato with a spoonful of natural yoghurt.

== BBC Good Food

Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Rub a little oil and seasoning over the potatoes, then bake on a baking sheet for 25 mins. Turn down the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and bake for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins more until the flesh is tender and the skin crisp and golden. For a quicker option, prick a potato with a fork. Wrap in a sheet of kitchen paper and microwave on High for 8-10 mins until soft inside. For crisp skin, rub with a little oil, then flash under a hot grill, turning often. To serve, slice a cross in the centre, squeeze the base to ‘pop’ the top, then choose your favourite filling.

*Ingredients* +

=== Turkey Chilli Jacket Potatoes

image::turkey-chilli-jacket-potato.png[]

*Ingredients* (serves 4) +
4 large baking potatoes +
1 tbsp olive oil +
1 onion, chopped +
1 garlic clove, crushed +
300g turkey mince +
1 tbsp smoked paprika +
1 tbsp ground cumin +
1 tbsp cider vinegar +
1 tbsp soft light brown sugar +
350ml passata +
reduced-fat red leicester, grated, to serve +
4 spring onions, chopped, to serve +


*Method* +


STEP 1
While the potatoes are cooking, make the chilli. Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and some seasoning, and cook for 5 mins until soft. Add the turkey mince and season again, then increase the heat and break up the mince with the back of your spoon. When it’s cooked through, add the spices, vinegar, sugar and passata. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 mins or until the liquid has reduced.

STEP 2
Cut a cross in the top of each potato and spoon in the chilli. Serve each potato sprinkled with cheese and spring onions.

*Comments* +

* "added a green pepper and a fresh chilli with the onion and also added sweet paprika, some tomato ketchup, tomato purée and Worcestershire sauce as well as a beef stock cube before the passata,didn’t add the sugar or vinegar."

* "This was WAY too sweet - did anyone else find it so? On reheating leftovers I added Worcester sauce and extra vinegar which took the sweetness down a notch.."

* "This is a good base recipe and turkey mince is a lovely alternative. However, like others I’ve adapted this recipe and added bits. I would recommend whilst adding the spices to **also add a tablespoon of chilli powder, a generous few dash of Worcestershire sauce, 100mls of veg/beef stock, mix together** and then I also **add 1 finely chopped pepper**- colour of your choosing, and **beans/kidney beans. Add the Passata and simmer**"

* "This is a really good and easy alternative to beef mince. Since turkey mince comes in packs of 500g, and passata in 500ml, I used all of that and doubled the garlic, spices, sugar and vinegar. Could have doubled onion too but I didn't have any more. I added hot chilli powder which I think gave it more depth. I also ignored the jacket potato instructions and did my usual 20 mins at 200 and 60 mins at 180 (fan)."

* "After reading the comments I decided to add a few extras to add some flavor - increased the paprika and cumin, added a beef stock cube, Worcestershire sauce, chilli powder and some taco mix that I already had in. I took a bit longer than 10 mins to reduce, but tasted yummy. I guess it all depends if you like it mild or spicy - I guess its one recipe you can play around with."

* "I used tinned tomatoes in place of pasatta, tastes fantastic, perfect consistency, needs time to bring the flavours out of the spices and to reduce."

* "I added kidney beans too and also sweetcorn and pinch of mild chilli powder and it was really really good. Children and hubby gave it a big thumbs up!"

=== Double Bean & Roasted Pepper Chilli
image::double-bean-roasted-pepper-chilli-potato.png[]

*Ingredients* (servers 8) +

2 onions, chopped +
2 celery sticks, finely chopped +
2 yellow or orange peppers, finely chopped +
2 tbsp sunflower oil or rapeseed oil +
2 x 460g jars roasted red peppers +
2 tsp chipotle paste +
2 tbsp red wine vinegar +
1 tbsp cocoa powder +
1 tbsp dried oregano +
1 tbsp sweet smoked paprika +
2 tbsp ground cumin +
1 tsp ground cinnamon +
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes +
400g can refried beans +
3 x 400g cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed +
2 x 400g cans black beans, drained and rinsed +

*Method* +

STEP 1
Put the onions, celery and chopped peppers with the oil in your largest flameproof casserole dish or heavy-based saucepan, and fry gently over a low heat until soft but not coloured.

STEP 2
Drain both jars of peppers over a bowl to catch the juices. Put a quarter of the peppers into a food processor with the chipotle paste, vinegar, cocoa, dried spices and herbs. Whizz to a purée, then stir into the softened veg and cook for a few mins.

STEP 3
Add the tomatoes and refried beans with 1 can water and the reserved pepper juice. Simmer for 1 hr until thickened, smoky and the tomato chunks have broken down to a smoother sauce.

STEP 4
At this stage you can cool and chill the sauce if making ahead. Otherwise add the kidney and black beans, and the remaining roasted peppers, cut into bite-sized pieces, then reheat. (This makes a large batch, so once the sauce is ready it might be easier to split it between two pans when you add the beans and peppers.) Once bubbling and the beans are hot, season to taste and serve.
