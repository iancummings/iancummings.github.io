=== Baked Beans & Cheese

Roughly chop a garlic clove and fresh red chilli, and add to a saucepan with a tin of cannellini beans, plum tomatoes, smoked paprika and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Stir and simmer until thickened. Spoon over your potato and add a sprinkling of grated Cheddar cheese. 

=== Rainbow Slaw

Grate up a colourful mix of red cabbage, carrot, apple, red onion and gherkins and dress with a splash of the gherkin juice, extra virgin olive oil and your choice of soft herbs, then use it to top your potato. Crumble over feta cheese and sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts for extra crunch.

=== Caramelised Red Onion & Bacon

Roughly chop smoked streaky bacon (200g) and fry off with thinly sliced red onion and a handful of fresh thyme sprigs. Stir through (much more than a) handful of baby spinach leaves, then pile into your potato with a spoonful of natural yoghurt.
