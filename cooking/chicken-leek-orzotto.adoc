Serves 2

== Ingredients
* 1 large leek (about 250g), washed and trimmed +
* 20g Essential Unsalted Butter +
* 1 dash/es olive oil +
* 1 clove/s garlic, finely chopped +
* 150g orzo pasta +
* 400ml chicken or vegetable stock +
* 100g frozen Essential Petits Pois +
* 80g Castello Tickler Mature Cheddar, finely grated +
* zest & juice of ½ lemon
* decorate with parsley

== Method
1. Halve the leek lengthways, then halve again into quarters and finely slice. Heat the butter and olive oil in a medium-large saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the leek, chopped garlic and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes until soft but without any colour.

2. Add the orzo to the pan and stir through the leek. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add 400ml stock to the pan, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cook for about 4 minutes, stirring regularly, then stir in the peas. Cook for another 4 minutes, adding a little more stock if it looks dry at any point (it should be a loose consistency). Taste the orzo; it’s ready when tender but with just a little bite.

3. Take off the heat and stir in ½ of the Cheddar, then let stand for 2 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and serve with a grinding of black pepper.

Cook’s tip
Stock 

Use the fresh kind if you can in this recipe; its flavour will really come through in the orzotto.
