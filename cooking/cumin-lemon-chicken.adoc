=== Method (Official)

1. Preheat the grill to high. Toss the chicken in a bowl with ½ tbsp oil, ½ tsp cumin, the garlic and the juice of ½ lemon; season and set aside. Put the rice in a large saucepan and cover with plenty of cold water. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes; drain.

2. Meanwhile, heat the remaining ½ tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt; fry for 10 minutes, stirring, until just golden. Add the butter, leek and carrots and fry for another 3-4 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 tsp cumin, the cinnamon and cranberries; fry for another 2-3 minutes. Stir through the drained rice and the remaining juice of ½ lemon; check the seasoning.

3. Arrange the chicken fillets in a foil-lined shallow baking tray and grill for 5-6 minutes on each side, until the juices run clear and there is no pink meat. Toss the parsley through the rice, then stir most of the lemon zest through the yogurt, with the remainder sprinkled on top. Serve the chicken with the rice and the lemon yogurt alongside.
