Sticky onion gravy http://www.jamieoliver.com/magazine/recipes-view.php?title=sticky-onion-gravy
serves 4
• 20g butter
• 2–3 onions, finely sliced
• 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
• 2 tsp flour
• ½ glass of red wine
• 250ml chicken or veg stock
• 1–2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

1. Melt the butter in a wide, shallow pan over a medium heat.
   Add the onion and garlic, then cook over a medium-low heat until golden and soft, stirring regularly.
   Add a splash of water any time it looks too dry.

2. Once golden and soft, put a lid on and cook for another 10 minutes or so over a low heat.
   The onions should be falling apart and a lovely deep brown colour, but not burning.
   (some recipes say add 1tps sugar here)

3. Stir in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes before stirring in the red wine.
   Bubble to reduce and cook off the alcohol a little, about 2–5 minutes,
   then add the stock and season slightly to taste.

4. Cook, stirring, for 15 minutes more, or until the gravy is soft, sticky and delicious.
    Finally, stir through a splash of balsamic vinegar

Optional:
mustard
worcester sauce
