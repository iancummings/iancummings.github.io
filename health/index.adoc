Preparing for a PSA test
For 48 hours before your PSA test, do not:

have anal sex
ejaculate (come)
do anything that leaves you out of breath, such as exercise
These can increase your PSA levels which could make the test less accurate.

You can eat and drink as usual before having a PSA test.

The amount of PSA in your blood is measured in nanograms (a billionth of a gram) per millilitre of blood (ng/ml).

For many men, normal PSA levels are usually less than 3ng/ml. But this will vary from person to person and depends on a lot of things including:

your age
your general health
if you have any urinary symptoms
if you are on any medication.
Your doctor will tell you what your own PSA level should be.
