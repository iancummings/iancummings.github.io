All of us behave in ways we don’t like sometimes 🙋‍♀️, but there are several ways you can check whether you’re being emotionally mature. (Remember, if you read this and recognise there are areas for improvement, no one is perfect, and being open to honest self reflection is, in itself, a sign of maturity).

🌻 You pause before reacting: You give yourself space to respond intentionally, even when you’re triggered.

🌻 You own your mistakes: No excuses, no blaming the other, just accountability. Being able to apologise for your part with no “buts”.

🌻 You can hear feedback without falling apart or lashing out: You see it as information, not an attack.

🌻 You regulate, not repress, emotions: You feel deeply but don’t let feelings control your behaviour.

🌻 You set and respect boundaries: Without guilt or aggression.

🌻 You can sit with discomfort: Whether it’s sadness, boredom, anger, or uncertainty, you don’t have to escape it instantly by running away or numbing yourself out.

🌻You see things from others’ perspectives, even when you disagree.

🌻You can disagree without disrespect: Conflict doesn’t have to destroy connection.

🌻You don’t need to win every argument: Sometimes peace is more important than being “right.”
