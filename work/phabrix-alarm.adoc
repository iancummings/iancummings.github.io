Hi Debbie
Thank you for your email.  
Polling failures are when the Alarm Receiving Centre sends a status request to the signalling device installed at your premises and did not get a reply.
The request is usually repeated several times, and usually restores OK.  
If the polling failure persists, your keyholders may be informed. 
For any engineer assistance required during office hours please ring 01635 261654.  
For calls outside of office hours please ring the duty engineer on 01635 528899

Kind Regards

Alyson
