My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7117278600">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A generally light hearted journey through the life and times of Sue Perkins. I'll be honest, although her use of language is very clever/witty it started to slightly annoy me about a quarter of the way in. Happily about half way through I relaxed into it and enjoyed the rest of the book. It does reveal a slightly more haphazard, disorganised Sue Perkins than the one I thought I knew, but maybe things have been exaggerated for the listener's pleasure (she does say something like that at the beginning) so my impression may be incorrect.<br />Overall a good read especially if you're of the same generation and/or hail from south east London like me.
