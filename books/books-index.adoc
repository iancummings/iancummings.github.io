My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7347081966">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I wasn't sure what to expect from this book as it was described as a mystery, but also following the lead character's development of dementia. Having finished it, I can now see that it is an accurate description but it's by no means a typical mystery book.<br /><br />I think that the "blurb" largely misleads the potential reader about what to expect - don't read this if you want an Agatha Christie, read it if you want to explore dementia using a mystery as a vehicle.<br /><br />While this book couldn't have been written by a person with dementia, it did an excellent job of making me believe that I was getting an insight into what it must be like experiencing the slow loss of cognition and memory. I had a small lump in my throat at the very end, and no book has done that to me for a very long time.<br /><br />The characterisation of the main character and her various family members in relation to the dementia seems spot on to me and I applaud the author for the way she portrayed them all and their relationships. The daughter and grand-daughter seemed so familiar to me (having been through this with parents & parents-in-law), that it made me believe the main character implicitly.<br /><br />As I said, this has to be an imagining of the mind of the main character but it's done so delicately and with such affection that it is a "must read" for anyone who has contact with someone suffering from dementia; it makes you a much more understandable companion.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7262844300">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I'm very much enjoying this series. This one (#3) has a slightly different slant as one of the Slow Horses themselves gets kidnapped, although we're not sure why until a good way into the book.<br />We get to know more of various characters' backstories and Jackson Lamb is on top form as usual.<br />We also get to know more about the first and second desks so another winner all round really.<br />I've given it four rather than five stars as for some reason it didn't quite have me on the edge of my seat like the other two have. I can't explain why, but it's still a great read.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7211990718">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I had read the first two Slow Horses and was about to jump onto Real Tigers when I found the list including the novellas so I have read both <i>The List</i> (see other review) and <i>Nobody Walks</i>. This one is a good length (6 hours audiobook) which makes for a decent story arc. It gives a further introduction to JK Coe after The List and he has a good amount of the action. Dame Ingrid makes her presence felt too.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this and I think it's well worth reading if you're going through the series, and also can be read out of sequence.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7117278600">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A generally light hearted journey through the life and times of Sue Perkins. I'll be honest, although her use of language is very clever/witty it started to slightly annoy me about a quarter of the way in. Happily about half way through I relaxed into it and enjoyed the rest of the book. It does reveal a slightly more haphazard, disorganised Sue Perkins than the one I thought I knew, but maybe things have been exaggerated for the listener's pleasure (she does say something like that at the beginning) so my impression may be incorrect.<br />Overall a good read especially if you're of the same generation and/or hail from south east London like me.

A nice little story in the usual style. Great dialogue from Lady Di as usual and the introduction of a couple of new characters that I hope will appear in later books (otherwise, I'm not sure it's worth the effort, even as small as it is).

I'd not read any William Boyd before but gave this a go because of the Costa award. I very much enjoyed it. The switching back and forth between past and present is reasonably easy to follow and the ending is decent too (often one of the hardest parts of a book).

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7104727042">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I think 4/5 is a fair score for this. It's the same witty prose as Satsuma and for most of the book carries you along with the same mixture of great dialogue and impossible situations. The ending is a little weak although not that bad - and we had to get to a happy ending somehow!<br />I have listened, rather than read, both books and I think that's definitely the preferred medium; Bob's words read by him are what you're after here and the inclusion of Sally Philips and Julie Masie complete a thoroughly enjoyable listen.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7067288255">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I put up with this book, rather than enjoyed it.<br /><br />The central character is a maid and she is autistic. There's nothing wrong with that of course, but the author obviously wanted to give us a feeling of what autism is like for some people (autism is many things to many people) although nobody actually says the word in the book. Sadly it felt to me like the author had made a list of neurodivergent traits from a 10 minute internet search. The resultant slog through the book really did get me down; this is supposed to be a murder mystery but the plot is very plodding and formulaic.<br /><br />The ending is what finished it for me; it seemed to upturn all of what Molly said she stood for.<br />I shan't be reading the next in this series.<br /><br />PS I read this as a audiobook in case that's relevant
