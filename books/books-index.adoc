Another solid contribution to the series. I had to concentrate quite hard during the final section as there are several people/groups wandering around and to keep track of who is where is definitely required so that you don't get lost yourself!<br /><br /><a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[I do find it refreshing show the author has no qualms about bumping off characters that you just started to get to know and were assuming would be with you until the end of the series! <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />On to the next :-)

A very good introduction to Lech, and now perfectly lined up for Joe Country.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7653132100">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A slightly unusual story premise but good nevertheless. Interesting characters and a good mix of story arcs to follow along the way. If I was going to criticise at all, I think some of the imagery was a little unimaginative, but it's such a small thing I should probably not mention it.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly from Ms Jones, the characters are well drawn and easy to like; most of them having a good mixture of good and bad traits.<br /><br />A good entertaining read!

Another winner from Mr Herron. You always know that Ms Taverner will try to close down Slough House at the end of the book, and that Lamb will somehow get out of it. This particular twist was very nicely done IMO; quite believable yet more than enough for the Slow Horses to live another day.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7600357992">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Given the number of books Afua has written about race, identity, Britain, etc. I guess I was never going to get all the answers here, and to be fair she doesn't promise to provide any. So unsurprisingly I found this a bit of a curate's egg. I have to start by saying that she's nailed the title, and it describes the book perfectly.<br /><br />The good: she has provided me with much more of an honest insight to what it's like being black in a white society. I also understand better why someone of mixed race would call themselves "black" while being mixed race and having brown skin - call me ignorant, but it's often difficult to get civil answers to questions like these.<br />She's very honest about her privileged upbringing and the fact that she didn't suffer racism in quite the same way as many from poorer backgrounds.<br /><br /><br />The bad: she talks about but doesn't explore enough (IMO) the "I don't see race" statement from the (usually) white point of view; why people say it and the fear behind it.<br />I think we all know that racism is all around us, and anyone choosing to read this book are likely to be even more aware, so it was a little repetitive to have quite so many examples and statistics of how widespread racism is in Britain today. I know she's trying to illustrate the points she's making in the book, but for me it just distracted from the much more insightful points being put forward.<br /><br />I was interested that she said hardly anything abut her Jewish identity. Maybe it's because her appearance is not typically Jewish and so she hasn't experienced antisemitism in quite the same way, or maybe she just doesn't feel Jewish.<br /><br />I know that she doesn't promise any answers, but at the end of the book, I do feel like we all agree that things need to change, but that nobody has any idea of how to achieve it.

Gosh this was a mistake. As someone else has mentioned, if it wasn't free on Audible's catalogue I'd be asking for a refund of my credit.<br /><br />In my opinion this book has formulaic dialogue, cliched backstories, shallow characters, and a barely credible storyline plodding on struggling to find some original content. <br /><br />There are lots of other reviews where people have enjoyed this so I guess the book and I are just mismatched.

A good tale of wizards, dwarfs, dragons, and of course a Hobbit.<br />Despite being a great age, I have never read this before; and while it's a slightly dated style, it is still a good story.

only a third of the way through, but not loving it yet. It's ok, maybe things will improve...<br /><br />Ok, so things did improve. This did seem like an author trying to find his/her style; maybe just with this character but it didn't flow as smoothly as I would have liked. Having said that, the plot is good and it develops well and finishes nicely. This is the first of many books involving this character I understand so I will probably try another to see how things go as I know that the series is well regarded.

Another winner as far as I'm concerned; enough familiarity so that you can jump straight back in, but also some surprises and a lot more backstory revealed.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7347081966">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I wasn't sure what to expect from this book as it was described as a mystery, but also following the lead character's development of dementia. Having finished it, I can now see that it is an accurate description but it's by no means a typical mystery book.<br /><br />I think that the "blurb" largely misleads the potential reader about what to expect - don't read this if you want an Agatha Christie, read it if you want to explore dementia using a mystery as a vehicle.<br /><br />While this book couldn't have been written by a person with dementia, it did an excellent job of making me believe that I was getting an insight into what it must be like experiencing the slow loss of cognition and memory. I had a small lump in my throat at the very end, and no book has done that to me for a very long time.<br /><br />The characterisation of the main character and her various family members in relation to the dementia seems spot on to me and I applaud the author for the way she portrayed them all and their relationships. The daughter and grand-daughter seemed so familiar to me (having been through this with parents & parents-in-law), that it made me believe the main character implicitly.<br /><br />As I said, this has to be an imagining of the mind of the main character but it's done so delicately and with such affection that it is a "must read" for anyone who has contact with someone suffering from dementia; it makes you a much more understandable companion.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7262844300">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I'm very much enjoying this series. This one (#3) has a slightly different slant as one of the Slow Horses themselves gets kidnapped, although we're not sure why until a good way into the book.<br />We get to know more of various characters' backstories and Jackson Lamb is on top form as usual.<br />We also get to know more about the first and second desks so another winner all round really.<br />I've given it four rather than five stars as for some reason it didn't quite have me on the edge of my seat like the other two have. I can't explain why, but it's still a great read.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7211990718">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I had read the first two Slow Horses and was about to jump onto Real Tigers when I found the list including the novellas so I have read both <i>The List</i> (see other review) and <i>Nobody Walks</i>. This one is a good length (6 hours audiobook) which makes for a decent story arc. It gives a further introduction to JK Coe after The List and he has a good amount of the action. Dame Ingrid makes her presence felt too.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this and I think it's well worth reading if you're going through the series, and also can be read out of sequence.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7117278600">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A generally light hearted journey through the life and times of Sue Perkins. I'll be honest, although her use of language is very clever/witty it started to slightly annoy me about a quarter of the way in. Happily about half way through I relaxed into it and enjoyed the rest of the book. It does reveal a slightly more haphazard, disorganised Sue Perkins than the one I thought I knew, but maybe things have been exaggerated for the listener's pleasure (she does say something like that at the beginning) so my impression may be incorrect.<br />Overall a good read especially if you're of the same generation and/or hail from south east London like me.

A nice little story in the usual style. Great dialogue from Lady Di as usual and the introduction of a couple of new characters that I hope will appear in later books (otherwise, I'm not sure it's worth the effort, even as small as it is).

I think 4/5 is a fair score for this. It's the same witty prose as Satsuma and for most of the book carries you along with the same mixture of great dialogue and impossible situations. The ending is a little weak although not that bad - and we had to get to a happy ending somehow!<br />I have listened, rather than read, both books and I think that's definitely the preferred medium; Bob's words read by him are what you're after here and the inclusion of Sally Philips and Julie Masie complete a thoroughly enjoyable listen.

I put up with this book, rather than enjoyed it.<br /><br />The central character is a maid and she is autistic. There's nothing wrong with that of course, but the author obviously wanted to give us a feeling of what autism is like for some people (autism is many things to many people) although nobody actually says the word in the book. Sadly it felt to me like the author had made a list of neurodivergent traits from a 10 minute internet search. The resultant slog through the book really did get me down; this is supposed to be a murder mystery but the plot is very plodding and formulaic.<br /><br />The ending is what finished it for me; it seemed to upturn all of what Molly said she stood for.<br />I shan't be reading the next in this series.<br /><br />PS I read this as a audiobook in case that's relevant
