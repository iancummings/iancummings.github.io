The format of the file dumped from LTM is just tables and contents, no database. So we should

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE livetouch DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
----

then to import the database we use a MySQL command line window or Heidi comme ca:

[source,sql]
----
mysql> use db_name;

mysql> SET autocommit=0 ; source the_sql_file.sql ; COMMIT ;
----
Regarding the time taken for importing huge files: most importantly, it takes more time because the default setting of MySQL is autocommit = true.


or on the command line:

[source,cmd]
----
c:\> mysql -u username -p database_name < file.sql
----

[NOTE]
====
* It is better to use the full path of the SQL file file.sql.
* Use -R and --triggers to keep the routines and triggers of original database. They are not copied by default.
