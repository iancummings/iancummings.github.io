https://superuser.com/questions/947392/windows-10-search-cant-find-any-applications-even-calculator


I have no idea why or what I have broken in the process. But here is what worked for me.

Ctrl+Shift+Right-click on an empty part of the taskbar and clicking "Exit Explorer" (or kill it via Task Manager if that doesn't work).

Delete this registry key.

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderTypes\{ef87b4cb-f2ce-4785-8658-4ca6c63e38c6}\TopViews\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}`

Start process Explorer.exe via Task Manager.

==== Map a drive letter to a folder
In order to map a directory (let’s assume it is located at d:\zdrive) onto an actual z: drive, we do a registry tweak.  Navigate to here:
 
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Session Manager\DOS Devices
 
and add a new string key called "Z:" with the value "\DosDevices\D:\ZDrive".

This may need a reboot to stick.

==== Fix disk collision in Windows
(https://www.howtohaven.com/system/change-disk-signature.shtml)

Windows 7 comes with a command line utility called `diskpart` that can let you view and change the disk signature.

1. Open a command prompt as administrator. To do this in Windows 7, click the Windows start menu (the round Windows icon on the left bottom corner), type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), right click the "cmd.exe" item that appears at the top of your menu, and click the line "Run as administrator". Do this even if you are already logged in as administrator, since on Windows 7, administrators run with reduced rights by default.

1. A black command prompt window will open. In Windows 7, the title bar of the window will tell you that you are running it as Administrator. If it does not, it means you did not do what I just said above. Return and follow the first step, or you will not be able to successfully carry out the rest of this tutorial.

1. Type "diskpart" (without the quotation marks) into the window. (Note: for this and the other commands described here, you'll have to hit the ENTER key after you finish typing your commands for them to take effect.)

1. Microsoft DiskPart will start. When it is ready, it will issue a "DISKPART>" prompt, allowing you to enter your commands.

1. Type "list disk" (without the quotation marks). This will list all the disks that are currently mounted (connected to the system). The disk will not have the usual names and labels that you're accustomed to from the Windows Explorer interface, so you will have to recognize them by their sizes.

NOTE: that "list disk" actually lists the physical disks, and not the partitions that you may have assigned drive letters. This means that if you have 2 physical disks, with 3 partitions on each, so that you have drives C:, D:, E:, F:, G: and H:, "list disk" will only show "Disk 0" and "Disk 1".

[start="6"]
1. To view the signature of a disk, you must first select it. To select a disk, type "select disk x" (without the quotation marks) where x is the number of the disk from your "list disk" display. When you type (say) "select disk 1", DiskPart will respond by telling you "Disk 1 is now the selected disk". +
Now type "uniqueid disk" (again, without the quotation marks). DiskPart will respond with the disk's signature, a series of hexadecimal digits (or at least I think it's hexadecimal).

1. To change the signature to some other number, type "uniqueid disk ID=[NEW SIGNATURE]" (without the quotation marks) where "[NEW SIGNATURE]" stands for the new identifier you want for the disk (without the square brackets and without the quotation marks). However, before you do that, you may want to type "help uniqueid disk", which will give you more information on how the command works. You may also want to find out the disk signatures of the other disks on the system before you modify your current one so that you don't cause a new signature collision while trying to solve this one. In addition, if you're really not sure how many digits you should give your disk, perhaps try changing only one digit of the current signature (eg, increasing or decreasing it by 1). Remember my disclaimer above: I really don't know what I'm talking about here. Do it at your own risk.

8. To quit DiskPart, type "exit". Incidentally, in case you get lost while running DiskPart, when you are at the "DISKPART>" prompt, you can type "help" to get a list of commands. Typing "help" followed by the command typically gives you more info about that command.

Once you've quit DiskPart, type "exit" again to quit the Administrator Command Prompt.

==== Copy disk
'**Scale to Fit**' will ignore unallocated space at the end of the source drive and scale the partitions to fill the destination drive. '**Scale to Target**' will retain unallocated space at the end of the source drive and scale it along with the partitions.

[NOTE]
====
When enabled, the *Automatic Scaling Restrictions* option prevents small partitions from being automatically scaled when restoring or copying a full drive. Partitions with a size of 15GiB or 1/8 the drive size (whichever is less) or smaller will not be scaled when restoring a full drive image or copying a full drive. This provides an automatic method to avoid scaling system reserved, recovery, and utility partitions to larger sizes when upgrading to a larger drive.

== Windows Updates - how to control what happens
=== Method 1 - Change Group Policy Editor settings
From link:https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/4-ways-to-disable-windows-updates/[here]

Learning to stop Windows Updates through the Group Policy Editor is also helpful. Here’s how you can use this method:

1. Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box.
1. Type `gpedit.msc` and press Enter to open the Group Policy Editor.
1. Navigate to “Computer Configuration” > “Administrative Templates” > “Windows Components” > “Windows Update.”
1. Double-click on “Configure Automatic Updates” to open the settings.
1. Either +
a. Select the “Disabled” option to turn off automatic updates, or
a. Select the “Enabled” option and configure from left hand drop down box.

1. Click on “Apply” and then “OK” to save the changes.

Using the Group Policy Editor allows you to have more granular control over Windows updates. You can choose to disable automatic updates entirely or configure specific update settings according to your preferences.

=== Method 2
From link:https://superuser.com/questions/1817039/disable-automatic-restarts-windows-11[here] +

You can disable automatic restart after installing updates in the Group Policy Editor.

1. Open the Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`).
1. Go to Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. +
1. Go to Legacy Policies +
1. Double-click on “No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations”. +
1. Select Enabled, and then select OK.

Note: This policy applies only when Automatic Updates is configured to perform scheduled installations of updates. If the "Configure Automatic Updates" policy is disabled, this policy has no effect.

Possibly also set the below to "2" - notify only. +

 Administrative Templates
   > Windows Components
     > Windows Update
       > Manage end user experience
         > Configure Automatic Update


=== Method 3

(from link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-restart#registry-keys-used-to-manage-restart[Microsoft.com])

You don't seem to be able to stop them all the time, but you can stop them if the user is logged on.

Use regedit and go to `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU`, then set `NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers` to '1'

=== Method 4
To block all updates, you can use this link:https://www.sordum.org/9470/windows-update-blocker-v1-8/[update blocker]

See link:https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-stop-automatic-updates/[this] page for details.


=== Home edition
If you have Windows 11 Home edition, execute the following commands in a command prompt (not PowerShell) to install Group Policy Editor:

 FOR %F IN ("%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-ClientTools-Package~*.mum") DO (DISM /Online /NoRestart /Add-Package:"%F") FOR %F IN ("%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-ClientExtensions-Package~*.mum") DO (DISM /Online /NoRestart /Add-Package:"%F")

=== Windows11 24H2
This update seemed to prevent the VM from running the fast virtualisation. The green tutle was visible and hovering showed the that the "execution engine" wasn't "VT-x/AMD-v". +
Check the fixes for last time; `Windows Security, Core Isolation, Memory Integrity = off`, and Windows Features (see below).

It seems that this time the key to it all can possibly be viewed via the SystemInformation app. Look for **Virtualization-based security**. It should show "Not enabled" or similar rather than "running".

I changed various settings to get to the point where VB would run "properly" including upgrading the version of VB and re-installing the Guest Additions (under Devices menu).

The last link here is probably the most useful. I set/cleared flags in at least two places in the registry, added a group Policy value and tried

I think the thing that actaully worked was usig the DG Readiness tool from MS to disable _Device Guard_ and _Credential Guard_ - see link:dgreadiness_v3.6.zip[here] by running it with `-disable` option. Then you reboot and as it boots it asks you if you really want to do this.
