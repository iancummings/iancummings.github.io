- we need some sort of timescale for the MVP of the player - what's the first feature it must support?
- Do we really need UHD for December?
- sending assetts to AM - automatic by tag?

Will the current genQ VP cope with UHD?
if so lovely, if not - do we really need that for Dec -> Damon
If not, then which next feature is dependant on the new player?
Who will take over the library service as I'm not soing that? Rosters and Storage of speed presets for example...

14135 - Anthony getting round the fact that there's no POST with a tagsheet as a body

================================================================

Some Questions, then T-shirt size the NAB epics/features

4. Regarding the ‘clip cue editing for each input channel’ TV Globo recently provided additional feedback on this. 
“We have different vendors that are capable to  do mark in-out operations independently for each channel. It was not possible to do a similar operation on AMPP Replay.”
5. Multiple Output Ports (8683) - ask Andrew - assign to Andrew and ask him to sort it!
  


1. Extended Tags (Rosters) - 5 points? 8
  a) Import on UI - no change
  b) TagModel object - no change -> Library Service - no change?
  c) App UI changes
  d) Export XML changes
	2. Week for Andrew to scope UHD? - 5 points?
	3. Scope of new player required - ???
	4. Can we close Epic PBS? (9644) - need public release
	5. Can we close Epic AMPP connected LiveTouch Panel (5366)? - need public release

speed preset

========================================
ado-16593 - roll out library service
===========================================
3. Identifying Training Needs "key elements of career growth & development is facilitating adequate training..."


Phil Johnson

1. What products does he cover? bbc sky, ibtel, ndr, rogers

2. Items to be worked on from Ian Stoner's list?
2. Who tests - only Ian Stoner?
3. Which physical machines does he use?

6 monthly

=====================================================================================

iops? 1000 iops
enough cache?
too close to live ? Can change in code but needs a rebuild at least!
ran out of gpu - one recording failed


======================================================================================

Thanks Nick.

We’ve chatted this issue over with Vincent Trussart amongst others, and he says that the Isolon really isn’t the type of device that should be used for recording; it might cite very impressive bandwidth figures, but the IOPS figure is not good and in his experience it has a reputation for just “going away for a bit” at times, which we’ll have difficulty coping with.

We would still like to investigate, but I thought I’d just keep people up to date.

HOWTO.txt - tagged blobs

If you are not familiar with the content of kernel\HOWTO.txt you should read it!

I have modified it to include the following information about tagged blobs. I include the sections about version.h and blob version numbers in case you have forgotten...

Regards, David.

{{{

HOWTO modify Version.h

----------------------

If you change the .reg file for a dll you need to change the Version.h file so that the registry is updated on start-up.

Version.h contains a 4 part version number. Changing any of the first 3 numbers will cause the registry to be updated.

Change the SECOND number if you make a registry change on Main Latest.

Change the THIRD number if you make a regsitry change on a branch.

This avoids version number clashes between different versions.

}}}

{{{

HOWTO modify blob version numbers

---------------------------------

If a blob contains a version number and does not use tags

then you should increment the version number when you make a change to the blob format.

Try to avoid making changes to the blob format or version number except in Main Latest.

Making changes on a branch needs to be done very carefully so that version numbers are unique

and so that customers can migrate backwards/forwards between software revisions.

}}}

{{{

HOWTO modify tagged blobs

---------------------------------

If a blob uses a tag reader to identify the contents, the existing values of the tags enum must NOT be changed.

This means that the contents of old blobs can always be read and the contents of newer blobs can be ignored where appropriate.

New tags MUST be added at the end of the tags enum.

Old tags MUST be preserved in the tags enum even when that data member is no longer read/written.

If the meaning of a data member is changed then it should be persisted with a new tag

so that it can be distinguished from the prior usage.

The blob version number should NOT be changed since this introduces unnecessary incompatibility.

}}}

Letter of Recommendation - Matthew Joyce
========================================
In a reference letter, be sure to include:
Your name and contact information.
Your personal background and relationship with the applicant.
A few of the applicant's strongest skills.
Concrete examples of the applicant's skills.
A closing statement.

Give details for how you know the applicant. The closer you've worked with her, the stronger your reference letter.
Paint the picture of why you recommend the candidate. Measurable achievements make a letter of reference sparkle.
Offer to talk more with the addressee.

Tips on writing a recommendation letter
Keep it positive. Your letter should confirm that you believe the person is a strong candidate for the job with no reservations. ...
Use a standard business letter format and tone. ...
Focus on the most important qualifications. ...
Follow the request instructions.

What is the format for a letter of recommendation?
Date.
Dear Sir/Madam.
State who you are recommending and for what.
Describe the capacity in which you know them.
List their most applicable qualities/traits.
Conclude by confidently recommending them.
Yours sincerely.


What to Include in Your Letter
A personal reference letter should provide information on who you are, your connection with the person you are recommending, why they are qualified, and the specific skills they have that you are endorsing. It should also include specific examples of times they demonstrated these skills. Review this template for ideas and suggestions on what to write and how to provide a compelling reference:

Salutation
When writing a character reference letter, include a salutation (Dear Dr. Jones, Dear Ms. Matthews, etc.). If you are writing a general letter, say "To Whom it May Concern" or don't include a salutation and start with the first paragraph of the letter.

Paragraph 1
The first paragraph of the character reference letter explains how you know the person you are recommending and why you are qualified to write a recommendation letter to recommend employment, college, or graduate school. With a personal letter, you are writing a recommendation letter because you know the person and their character, rather than because you have direct experience with their work or education.

Paragraph 2
The second paragraph of a reference letter contains specific information on the person you are writing about, including why they are qualified, what they can contribute, and why you are providing a reference letter. Use specific examples of times the employer demonstrated these skills or qualities. If necessary, use more than one paragraph to provide details.

Summary
This section of the reference letter contains a brief summary of why you are recommending the person. State that you "highly recommend" the person or you "recommend without reservation" or something similar.

Conclusion
The concluding paragraph of a reference letter contains an offer to provide more information. Include a phone number and/or email address within the paragraph and include the phone number and email address in the return address section of your letter, or in your email signature.

Sincerely,

Your Name
Title

Jane Jones
Human Resources
Acme Corp
10 Main Street
Anytown, CA 99999

Dear Ms. Jones,

It’s my pleasure to offer my unreserved recommendation for Megan Brown for the position of intern at Acme Corp.

I’ve known Megan for over 20 years, having lived next door to her since she was a child. She’s always demonstrated responsibility and entrepreneurial spirit. When she was a teenager, she started a snow shoveling business in our neighborhood and wound up managing a team of five other kids from the street. I’m fairly certain they pulled in enough money to buy their own plow… if any of them had been old enough to operate it.

Since then, I’ve watched with interest as she’s pursued her education and interest in business. Of course, you know from her transcripts and professional recommendations that she’s been unusually successful throughout her early career, but what you might not know is the joy she gets from solving problems and making business ideas work. It’s truly inspiring to see her tackle something and make it a success.

Megan would be an asset to any organization, but I know that she has a particular passion for your company. I’d be happy to answer any questions or discuss my recommendation further. Please feel free to call me at 555-555-5555.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Smith (signature for hard copy)

Elizabeth Smith

recommendation letters
The recommendation letter can play a crucial role in getting someone a job. The cv is generally considered the flagship document of the job application but it has strict limitations. Furthermore it’s entirely the claims of the applicant: recommendation letters provide the evidence and support to substantiate these claims. In the following recommendation letter samples you can see how to tactfully and effectively craft a letter which wins over the employer and helps someone get a position.

Recommendation Cover Letter Advice

Recommendation Letter Advice
The primary focus of the recommendation letter is to create a profile of the applicant that is completely unique. The letter must convince employers of this person’s indispensability and skill. However it must do this in a subtle manner. The letter shouldn’t simply state assertions but provide concrete evidence of results or examples of success in the workplace. Furthermore recommendation letters must:

Â• Include specific instances where the applicant applied unique skills or found a difficult solution

Â• Focus on the traits skills and experiences which address the requirements of the position

Â• Target the expectations of the employer by taking the details of the job into consideration

Â• Highlight the most unique abilities which distinguish this individual from other applicants

Dear Harvard Board of Admissions

I am writing this letter to you as a recommendation for admitting Leonard Staltz to your Academic programs. I had the privilege of having Leonard in three of my classes during his time in high school and I can tell you from first hand experience that Leonard is one of the hardest working students I have ever encountered.

Leonard has an exceptional ability to balance extracurricular activities with his classwork. He spends a great deal of time on the school campus running the school newspaper being involved with the school radio station and acting as president of the debate club. For most students this would be spreading themselves too thin. But Leonard also happens to be his class valedictorian so he can handle the load.

In my classes Leonard was always at the top of the class in terms of grades and respect from the other students. He is an extrovert which means that he became a resource for the students who were struggling. He would set aside his own time to tutor his classmates and help them to understand the material.

Leonard would be a significant asset to your school and would be a source of pride for you incoming class. Please call me at 555-322-3221 or email me at geofftate@email.com if you have any questions.

Sincerely Yours

Geoff Tate

IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN FOLKS 
THEY FIND THEIR WAY INTO OUR HOMES LOOKING FOR SAFETY
WHEN YOU FIND A BUMBLEYBEE THAT CAN'T FLY, FIRSTLY YOU CAN PICK THEM UP - THEY WILL NOT STING UNLESS YOU HURT THEM AND ARE SAFE TO HANDLE
SECONDLY, POP THEM IN A TUB IF THEY WILL LET GO OF YOUR WARM HAND
THIRDLY, MIX WARM WATER AN SUGAR TOGETHER AND HOLD SOME IN A TEASPOON INFRONT OF THEM TO THEIR FRONT LEGGIES
THEY WILL EXTEND THEIR PROBOSCIS (INBUILT CURLY STRAW) AND DRINK.
THEN TAKE THEM OUTSIDE, THEY WILL GROOM, MAYBE PEE ON YOU AND WILL FLY OFF
WHEN THEY ARE SAT UNABLE TO FLY AND STICK THEIR LEGGIES IN THE AIR IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE VULNERABLE AND TRYING TO FLY.
THEY ARE COLD AND NEED ENERGY

“The order of adjectives in English, at first, doesn’t seem to be fixed. However, as quoted by Mark Forsyth in The Elements of Eloquence, adjectives in English ‘absolutely have to be in this order:
    opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. 
So you can have ‘a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife.’ But if you mess with that order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac...
Some examples:
a French silver lovely rectangular green old whittling little knife.
a silver green old French lovely whittling little rectangular knife.
a lovely rectangular silver French little whittling old green knife.
They all just seem wrong.”

Try Pete Dollin (PDD Services) 01635 871885 or 0788 510 5006.  As well as being a chimney sweep, he replaces chimney cowls.  He did one of ours about a couple of years or so ago.

When I got this camera, I used mainly zone focussing as that technique had been proven by all masters and everyone doing street photography.
 Zone focussing means setting a fixed aperture (like f/8 or f/11) together with a minimum shutter time (like 1/250 to freeze the action
 or 1/500 when it's really sunny) and let the ISO to automatic. Then you manually focus on 1.5 meters and the result is that all
 between 1 meter and infinity is in focus. With this, you can fully focus on the composition and your subject.

Here an example why I don't like zone focussing. In this photo only the subject is sharp because of the larger aperture of f/1.7. Settings:

 

Shutter time of minimum 1/250s

Auto ISO with max of 6400

Manual aperture of f/1.7 in this case, up to f/2 or f/2.8 to isolate the subject

AUTO FOCUS meaning no point and shoot anymore

 

The failure rate is a lot worse, especially when your subjects are moving. f/1.7 gets you a very thin depth of field (even at 28mm) and when your subjects are walking they will get out of focus very fast so you set your aperture depending on the speed of your subject. Also: you have to compose well before taking the shot (meaning, set the focus point to the correct place)

 

Subject is:

 

standing still: f/1.7

walking slow: f/2

walking fast: f/2.8

 

2 people: f/2

4 people: f/4

 

and so on... Many examples will follow
