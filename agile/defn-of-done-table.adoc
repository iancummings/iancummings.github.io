.definition of "Ready"

A “ready” backlog item needs to be __clear__, _feasible_ and __testable__:

* A user story is clear if all Scrum team members have a shared understanding of what it means. Collaboratively writing user stories, and adding acceptance criteria to the high-priority ones facilitates clarity
* An item is testable if there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected. Acceptance criteria ensure that each story can be tested
* A user story is feasible if it can be completed in one sprint, according to the Definition of Done. If this is not achievable, it needs be broken down further

Simply stated, the Definition of Ready defines the criteria that a specific user story has to meet before being considered for estimation or inclusion into a sprint.

* User Story is clear
* User Story is testable
* User Story is feasible
* User Story defined
* User Story Acceptance Criteria defined
* User Story dependencies identified
* User Story sized by Development Team
* Scrum Team accepts User Experience artefacts
* Performance criteria identified, where appropriate
* Scalability criteria identified, where appropriate
* Security criteria identified, where appropriate
* Person who will accept the User Story is identified
* Team has a good idea what it will mean to Demo the User Story
