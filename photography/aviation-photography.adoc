From a talk by Steve Tron

== Techniques

=== General
* evalutive metering, with some exposure compensation +
(cos of sky in daytime or nighttime)

=== Static shots
* aperture priority
* one-shot focus

=== Dynamic shots
* shutter priority for propeller aircraft (to blur rotors, props)
** 1/160 - 1/500
** 1/60 for helicopter
* aperture priority for jets
** wide open
** shutter speed 1/800 - 1/1000
* often panning
** good for clurring background
* AI-servo focus (back button)
* turn off image stabilisation (especially when panning)
