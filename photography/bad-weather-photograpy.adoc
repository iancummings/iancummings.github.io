== Ideas
* the same location in different weathers

== Grey skies
"You can't change the weather, but you can change your location" +
Pick locations that match the greyness; abandoned places or areas that exude pathos.

== Rain
Urban locations, piers in particular, can transform themselves when wet. Do use a cover for your camera, have a microfibre cloth handy, and a lens hood helps keep out the rain.

== Ice & Snow

== Mist & Fog

== Wind
