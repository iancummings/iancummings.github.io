== Miscellaneous Tips

=== Shutter Speed
`[21:39, 1/15/2026] Cathy Davies: For my first tip.`

If you want the whole bird to be in full focus and wings sharp all the way to the tip, you need a really fast shutter speed. The smaller the bird the faster the shutter speed.

NOTE: remember that these are relatively high meaning your ISO will also have to be high

|===
| Bird size | Shutter speed

| Small | 1/3200 - 1/4000
| Medium bird | 1/2500 
| Large bird | 1/1250

__Question__: Is that because a smaller bird will be changing course more quickly than a larger bird?

__Answer__: Yes and they flap their wings much faster. If you had a slower shutter speed you could potentially end up with a bird body and hardly any wings. Depends what you want your photo to look like..
