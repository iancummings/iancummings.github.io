How to sort those images!

1. Load to intray and let synchronisation complete
1. Rawviewer +
either to weed out complete duffers, or to select a few good ones
1. PhotoLab - set filter to 
.. untagged +
and +
.. all star ratings _except_ 1 & 2

1. go through images
.. also rans get 1 or two stars -> and they disappear
.. duffers that have slipped through get red rejected -> they disappear
.. keepers are worked on and given a green picked -> they disappear

1. when all images gone from the carousel, reset the filter just to show green picked and process - last minute edits if necessary
1. Copy images from `processed` to other destination folders; __street__, __family__, _portfolio_ etc
