= Product Photography

== The set
Floor is black perspex, back is foamcore, a-clamped to a light stand

== Tips
* Wear gloves to keep things clean!
* don't move the product, move the perspex/floor
* manual focus
* tethered working is helpful
* fill the frame with the product
* small aperture (f14) for depth of field

== workflow
* take a test shot - should be totally black
* flash needs a grid / snood to stop light spilling to background
* for transparent objects (bottles, etc) we need a rear light to shine through from the back and show the contents.
* light behind black background to give edge rim light effect
