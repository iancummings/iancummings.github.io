= Abstract by Tony Worobiec

* Non-figurative
* non-representational

== Methods

* can invert colours to make it abstract
* reducing down to physical elements
* take image, copy, invert 180, blend
* maybe invert colours?
* use square format, it helps
* camera should be *__strictly__* parallel to subject so we get no perspective
* print it, and make it large - helps to make it appaer as art rather than photograph
* start with image, analyse it's constituent visual elements, that should help with how to make it more abstract
* requires some shape
* 2 or 3 visual elements only
* Rhythm is very important
* macro can help
* IR can help
* ICM can help
* multiple exposure in-camera
* hyper shallow depth of filed - dandilion heads for example
