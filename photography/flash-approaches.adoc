== Intro
A summary of different types of setups; a quick reminder to get me going!

==  General 'off-camera' flash
* use flash triggers
* set the camera to manual; Tv up to 1/250, F: anything you like! +
  This sets exposure for the background
* set flash to E-TTL via flash controller
* adjust flash compensation +
  This sets the exposure for the subject.

=== In Summary

* Manual mode
* Lowest ISO
* Maximum sync speed
* Select an aperture (ie f/5.6 as a starting point)
* Bring in the flash

=== In more detail
So, how do we achieve the "Black Backdrop"? +
Basically what we're looking to do is to tell the camera to capture no light other than what we introduce in the form of a speedlight flash for
example. We don't want the camera to pick up __any__ of the ambient/natural light at all, and by doing that we have an instant black backdrop.

1.Put your camera into MANUAL MODE +
Yes, now we are in control: Shutter Speed, Aperture, iso from this point onwards we're telling the camera what to do as opposed to the
camera telling us and giving us the picture it thinks we want.

2. ISO
Set your camera to it's lowest possible ISO. In laymen's terms, the iso dictates how sensitive to light your camera's sensor is i.e a low number
 like 200 means it's less sensitive to light whereas a higher number like 1600 means it's more sensitive to light. On a side note the higher
the iso number the more noise/grain can be introduced into your photograph, particularly in the shadow areas. Now, seeing as we're
looking to make a black backdrop we're not concerned with how sensitive to light the camera is, so we'll be keeping our iso as low as possible; in my case, my Nikon D3 can go down to 100 which means the camera isnâ€™t
very sensitive to light at all and the final picture will be nice and clean with minimal grain/noise.

3. Shutter Speed
Set your camera to its maximum/optimum sync speed.
 Basically this is the maximum speed that your camera and flash work together ie any faster than this and your camera's shutter is opening
and closing too quickly to allow all the light from your flash to fill
the camera's sensor. Common maximum sync speeds are in the 1/200th of a
second to 1/250th of a second. Now although we could quite easily make
the scene completely black by going to an incredibly high shutter speed
like 1/8000th second the problem with this is that the shutter will open
 and close so quickly that none of the light from the flash will hit the
 sensor, so we must stick to the maximum sync speed that our cameras and
 flashes work __together__.

4. Aperture
The final setting on our cameras is the aperture or basically what f-number we should select. Now, knowing roughly what 'f number to use
will become second nature after you've done this a few times so the best
 thing is to choose say, f/5.6 and go from there. Once you're at this
stage take a photo of your subject and see what results you get. The
objective here is to see absolutely nothing on your cameras display ie
you should see a completely black screen. Now, if you don't and you're
seeing a bit of the environment then clearly some natural/ambient light
is creeping into the scene. So, all we have to do is close down our f
number a little ie if you're getting natural/ambient light into the
photo at say f/5.6 then try going to f/8.0 and see what that gives you:

5. Bring in the flash
Now we've set the scene with our camera's and have a completely black screen, the final
phase to this technique is to 'bring in the flash. Where you prefer to
position your flash and what modifier you use is entirely down to you
depending on the look you want to achieve but I find I get great results
 using a reflective umbrella. This is a great piece of kit that
creates beautiful light but I can also 'close down' to control where I
want the light to fall and how much etc. +
Again experience of having done this a few times will dictate what power
level you put the flash on so until that time just pick a power level ie
 1/4 power, then take a shot and see what you get. If you want more
light then increase the power of the flash in increments until you get
what you want. If the light from the flash is too bright then simply
lower the power level in increments. +
As a rule, Shutter Speed controls Ambient/Natural light
and Aperture controls flash power but in this technique once we've set
both the shutter speed and aperture to give us our black background we
really need to leave them well alone and control the power of the flash
manually by walking over to (or better still having an assistant) adjust
 it by hand.

6. Triggering the flash +
As this technique uses 'off camera' flash we need to have a way of triggering our flash. I use Pocket Wizards which are the industry standard radio triggers; great pieces if kit, very reliable that work at ridiculous distances, but they do have a price tag to match. However, there are lots of alternative ways to trigger your flash from a simple 'sync lead' which forms a physical connection to your camera and flash (with obvious limitations), an infra red trigger, Nikon users can use their 'Pop-Up' flashes to trigger another flash using the Nikon CLS (Creative Lighting System) and there's even budget radio triggers you can get off ebay that seem to work just fine.
