Freezer working fine, fridge not getting cold, I can hear the compressor running and another quieter noise when the compressor isn't, not sure if this is the fan? but still temperature remains the same.

Hi, I'm Daniel and I'll be helping you today I've been repairing white goods for 20+ yrs. and currently work for a well-know manufacture.
The fridge on this model actually gets its cooling from the freezer. The fan in there blows the cold air into the fridge section.
When the fridge looses its cooling then it's usually down to the evaporator building up with too much ice. What you need to do is fully defrost the freezer. Turn it off for 24 hours and leave the freezer door open. This will allow the ice in the freezer evaporator to melt and clear the air vents in there.
Then retry the appliance and this should get the fridge cooling again. But if it does it again in say 3 weeks time then there's a fault on the auto defrost at fault. Now it's usually the defrost heater so you need to drop the evaporator housing down in the freezer when it's defrosted and check the heater. As when it's iced up its very hard to remove it as the ice blocks it up.
So try the above first and see what you find but if you need anymore info just get back to me.

Hello

Thanks for the reply. Just to be sure it is not the fan how can I tell if the fan is working, I assume that if I open the freezer door the soft noise i hear stops, when i push the big white button near the door hinge to simulate the door closing the noise starts again, is this the fan running?

Thats indeed how you can check the fan on this model. But sometimes the ices builds up and stops the fan from turning as it builds up around the fan blades so the fan may not run but only because the ice has jammed t not because it's faulty.
Or another way is remove the baskets inside the freezer and remove the back panel. Then you need to reach behind the plastic housing at the top. Feel in the middle at the back and you will feel the fan blade. See if you can turn it as well as if it's iced up then you won't be able to turn it

Hi Daniel

I can move the fan blades freely, and I can confirm that the fan is running when I push the button to operate. I can also confirm the compressor is working, Does this sound more likely to be the auto-defrost heater at fault as you suggested earlier?

Yeap its more then likely all blocked in the evaporator stopping the airflow to the fridge.

So try the defrost first as sometimes it can be just a one off but if it happens again then the defrost heater around the evaporator will be the fault on this.

I just took the plastic grill off to expose the evaporator, there isn't too much ice but there is some around some of the fins particularly at the edges, could this be enough to stop the fridge working.

If it comes down to a faulty heater, is it simple to replace?

The edges dont really get much ice its in the middle were it all builds up.

As you have the plastic grill off look under the evaporator housing unit at the front were the grill was and there you will see a 7mm screw either side holding the box to the roof.
Remove these and the then you can drop the hosuing box down a bit.

Then remove the polystrine cover in there which is tapped either side so thats the hard part and then remove this.

Now you can just use a hairdryer to defrost it from there.

Done that, there really isn't much ice trapped in the evaporator, but the polystyrene part is heavy with water like it has been saturated??

'is this normal?

Ok so there wasnt much ice or frost on there?

The polystyrene cover normal does go like that. But if the fan is running ok and there isnt much ice in the evaporator then its possbley the damper in the fridge but these very rarely fail. In fact i dont remember ever replacing one as its always either the fan in the freezer or the evaporator is blocked with ice.

Just clear all the ice you can from there and refit the housing and cover and see how it goes from there.

OK.

I have put it back together without the polystyrene is that ok for a day or so?? It is all a bit broken and could do with replacing.

Yes that will be fine for a few days.

So just see how it goes and let me know.

Customer
thank you. I will see in the morning if the fridge has started working,

good night.

You will know by then. Hopefully it will work if its not as cold as it should then it may be due to the polystrene not being on so when the fan blows the air through the evaporator its comming out the top due to the polystrene not being there.

But fingers crossed this will be cold in the morning.

Hello Daniel.

I put the evaporator assembly back together last night - minus the polystyrene part, (really could do with a new one this one is quite damaged; are they available?).

I switched on the unit and left it overnight, this morning the freezer was at the correct temperature but the fridge was at 7 degrees, before I took it apart it was at 10, so it was a bit better. When my wife came in from was this afternoon it was at 3 degrees the programmed temperature, so that was good news.

I am still a bit puzzled so would like to hear your opinion. The fan is working fine, the evaporator had some ice but not too much, could it be an intermittent fault with the diffuser??

Hi
Glad to hear the fridge seems to be ok again now. Its a bit of a strange fault to be honest.
As I said about the damper these hardly fail. I haven't had to replace one before, That's how often they fail.
I would keep an eye on the fan as it may be an intermitten fault on this as this can play up.
As to the polystyrene cover copy and paste the link below for the part. Its Â£5 direct from AEG so not that bad.

But fingers crossed this will be back to normal. If it goes again then just get back to me. Even after rating you can still come back to me on this that's not a problem.

Thanks very much. At least I have a good idea about the anatomy of a fridge freezer!! If I need to come back to you I will, you have been very helpful.

What do I do now......rate to finish or leave it open?

Hi
Your very welcome.
All you need to do now is just click the smiley face on the answer to rate.
But it doesn't close it fully as you can reopen it any time you want to come back to me.

Customer
Also where is best to buy other parts if I need to?

To be honest the link I gave for the cover is AEG direct and they are not that bad on prices. But there is Ebay as there are a lot of parts on there from online spares sites which are not that bad priced.
