1. **Reigning Iron**: Bleeding Fallout Remover (very smelly) +
Non-dilutable, apply and leave to dry 5-10mins +
Product will turn purple when reacting: +
"Iron Fallout Remover should be applied at Step 4: Decontamination, immediately following the wash stage. By this point, most of the dirt will have been removed, leaving only contaminants behind." +
"... fallout remover is formulated with a blend of advanced cleaning agents that latch onto iron particles, causing them to dissolve and be safely removed from the surface of your vehicle." +
__Purpose:
To safely and effectively remove embedded iron particles and other contaminants from the vehicle's paint, wheels, chrome, and glass. 
How it works:
The product uses chemicals to dissolve and break down the iron particles, allowing them to be rinsed away. 
Benefits:
Prevents corrosion and damage to the paint, improves the appearance of the vehicle, and prepares the surface for waxing or ceramic coatings. 
Types:
Some products are pH neutral, making them safe for use on various surfaces. Others may have a more acidic formula that requires more caution. 
Application:
Typically applied after washing and before waxing or coating. 
Color Change:
Many products change color when they react with iron, providing visual confirmation of the process.__
